# Activity Classification Lab

## Introduction

This lab work was made during the course of Applied Artificial Intelligence at ITMO University. Its goal was to classify data about people's activity types got from mobile sensors and research the differencies between models and their hyperparameters.

## Used Tools & Libraries

*  Python
*  Google Colab (CPU, T4 GPU) & Jupiter Notebook
*  NumPy
*  Pandas
*  MatPlotLib & Seaborn
*  Scikit-learn

## Work Process Description

*  **Data Preprocessing**: the distibution and characteristics of data were revealed.
*  **Models Selection**: 5 models from Scikit-learn library were selected for researching and training.
*  **Models Training**: selected models had been trained on the train dataset.
*  **Visualization**: every model training was followed by visualization of results â€“ I got Precision, Recall and F1-Score metrics by classification reports, printed the Accuracy scores and drew Confusion Matrixes.
*  **Models Comparison**: models were compared by Accuracy and F1-Score, the most and least applicable models were revealed and the results were explained.
